    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1. Built-in Functions:\n",
    "   - Built-in functions are functions that are provided by Python as part of its standard library. \n",
    "     They are readily available for use without the need to define them explicitly.\n",
    "   - These functions cover a wide range of common tasks and operations, such as mathematical calculations, \n",
    "     string manipulation, file operations, and more.\n",
    "   - Examples of built-in functions include `print()`, `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `str()`, `int()`, `float()`, `input()`, etc.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "#Example\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "2. User-Defined Functions:\n",
    "   - User-defined functions are functions that we create ourself, giving them a name and specifying the code \n",
    "     that should be executed when the function is called.\n",
    "   - These functions allow us to encapsulate a block of code and reuse it throughout our program, \n",
    "     making our code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "   - We define user-defined functions using the `def` keyword, followed by a function name \n",
    "     and a block of code within parentheses and an indented code block.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "#Example\n",
    "\n",
    "def Hello(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function takes a name as input and prints a greeting.\n",
